===============================================================================

If you'd like to create your own bot, follow the steps below to get started.

1. `git clone` this repo to your local machine
2. Navigate to the directory of the download and run `python3 create_bot.py <bot name>` to auto-generate a new bot
3. Get started writing your bot in the `main.py` file! You shouldn't need to change any of the other files unless your bot requires a specific configuration for Google Cloud
